		<h2>Shotput</h2>
		<img src="/images/shotput.png" />
		<p>Shotput started out as an idea I pitched on the <a href="http://www.startupbus.com" target="_blank">StartUp Bus</a>. The idea changed as we continued to build it - but we completed a working web application in less than 48 hours. Shotput was the winner of the Chicago bus.</p>

		<p>We were featured on the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/03/shotput-reaches-startup-bus-finals-at-sxsw.html" target="_blank">Twilio Blog</a> for this adventure of ours!</p>

		<h2>BloNoSquare</h2>
		<img src="/images/blonosquare.png" />
		<p>BloNoSquare was made for a class project. Using drinks as tags on foursquare, this site allowed you to search drinks and you can find out what bars in Bloomington-Normal, IL serve that drink. It also showed you yelp reviews and foursquare data for that bar.Why Bloomington-Normal? Because that's my college town.<p>

		<p>I used Twilio for this project, as well. By using twilio, it also let you search using SMS.</p>
