		<h2>Shotput</h2>
		<img src="/images/shotput.png" />
		<p>Shotput started out as an idea I pitched on the <a href="http://www.startupbus.com" target="_blank">StartUp Bus</a>. The idea changed as we continued to build it - but we completed a working web application in less than 48 hours. Shotput was the winner of the Chicago bus.</p>

		<p>We were featured on the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/03/shotput-reaches-startup-bus-finals-at-sxsw.html" target="_blank">Twilio Blog</a> for this adventure of ours!</p>
