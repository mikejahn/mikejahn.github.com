		<h2>BikeLock</h2>

		<p>
		BikeLock is an iPhone app to help you find bike racks near you in Chicago. The current data for Chicago is powered by The City of Chicago.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is no longer in the app store. I plan on releasing the source code soon.  In the meantime you can view a demonstration of the app here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7DgMLaAGpI">Youtube Video</a>

		<h2>Shotput</h2>
		<img src="/images/shotput.png" />
		<p>Shotput started out as an idea I pitched on the <a href="http://www.startupbus.com" target="_blank">StartUp Bus</a>. The idea changed as we continued to build it - but we completed a working web application in less than 48 hours. Shotput was the winner of the Chicago bus.</p>

		<p>We were featured on the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/03/shotput-reaches-startup-bus-finals-at-sxsw.html" target="_blank">Twilio Blog</a> for this adventure of ours!</p>

		<h2>BloNoSquare</h2>
		<img src="/images/blonosquare.png" />
		<p>BloNoSquare was made for a class project. Using drinks as tags on foursquare, this site allowed you to search drinks and you can find out what bars in Bloomington-Normal, IL serve that drink. It also showed you yelp reviews and foursquare data for that bar.Why Bloomington-Normal? Because that's my college town.<p>

		<p>I used Twilio for this project, as well. By using twilio, it also let you search using SMS.</p>
		
		<p>The site is currently down.</p>

		<h2>TextMeMySchedule</h2>
		<img src="/images/textmemyschedule.png" />
		<p>TextMeMySchedule was an idea I came up with a week before one of my semesters at college started. At the beginning of every semester, I would write down my school schedule. I would stare at that piece of paper until I knew it by heart.</p>

		<p>So I thought up a solution. The user has to put in their schedule and they will get a text everyday with their classes that day. But it only lasts for 2 weeks! (By then hopefully you know your schedule!) The <a href="http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/06/text-me-my-schedule-helps-students-make-it-to-class.html" target="_blank">Twilio Blog</a> featured me for this web application.</p>
